# ðŸ¤¹ As the Linguist, I can provide a code snippet that demonstrates the suggested architecture using the Template Method Pattern. Please note that this is a simplified example to illustrate the concept, and it may not include all the necessary details or error handling. Hereâ€™s an outline of the code structure:

# Base class representing the template method
class PackageBuilder
  def build_package
    set_colors
    define_locations
    mount_chroot
    update_chroot
    build_packages
    unmount_chroot
  end

  def set_colors
    # Implementation for setting colors
  end

  def define_locations
    # Implementation for defining locations
  end

  def mount_chroot
    # Implementation for mounting the chroot
  end

  def update_chroot
    # Implementation for updating the chroot
  end

  def build_packages
    # Implementation for building packages
  end

  def unmount_chroot
    # Implementation for unmounting the chroot
  end
end

# Subclass for setting colors
class ColorSetter < PackageBuilder
  def set_colors
    # Define color variables
    @color_red = "\e[31m"
    @color_green = "\e[32m"
    @color_yellow = "\e[33m"
    @color_reset = "\e[0m"

    # Usage example
    puts "#{@color_red}Error: Something went wrong!#{@color_reset}"
    puts "#{@color_green}Success: Package build completed!#{@color_reset}"
    puts "#{@color_yellow}Warning: This package has missing dependencies.#{@color_reset}"
  end
end

# Subclass for defining locations
class LocationDefiner < PackageBuilder
  def define_locations
    # Implementation specific to defining locations
  end
end

# Subclass for mounting and unmounting the chroot
class ChrootManager < PackageBuilder
  def mount_chroot
    # Implementation specific to mounting the chroot
  end

  def unmount_chroot
    # Implementation specific to unmounting the chroot
  end
end

# Subclass for updating the chroot
class ChrootUpdater < PackageBuilder
  def update_chroot
    # Implementation specific to updating the chroot
  end
end

# Subclass for building packages
class PackageBuilder < PackageBuilder
  def build_packages
    # Implementation specific to building packages
  end
end

# # Usage example
# builder = PackageBuilder.new
# builder.build_package


# In this example, the PackageBuilder class represents the base class with the template method build_package. Each component is implemented as a separate method in the base class and can be overridden in the subclasses to provide specific functionality. The subclasses ColorSetter, LocationDefiner, ChrootManager, ChrootUpdater, and PackageBuilder represent the individual components and provide their own implementations.
#
# By using this architecture, you can easily extend or modify the behavior of each component by creating new subclasses or overriding the methods in existing subclasses. This promotes code reusability and maintainability.
#
# Please let me know if you have any further questions or if thereâ€™s anything specific you would like to discuss about the code structure.
